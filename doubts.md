# Doubts to ask

- Is any loop better or are there any use cases where should use a particular type of loop?

   For example in counting digits of a number

- Does "return True" statement not overwrite any "False" we might have received in is_prime loop?

- is there any way to find power of a number easily instead of putting a loop?
